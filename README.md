# Script-Homework
Four Simple bash script that I wrote for class exercises.
Script 1: Get user's brith year and calculate age.
Script 2: Convert domain name to IP address
Script 3: Convert IP address to domain name
Script 4: Check connectivity to domain or IP

These exercise helped me gain a deeper understanding of terminal commands, input/output in bash, and networking
